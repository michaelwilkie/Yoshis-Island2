The last attempt on this project (now moved to the 'old' folder) was a flop for two reasons:
  1. The code was a mess. Circular includes everywhere causing almost unsolvable linker problems and poorly designed code that couldn't scale.
  2. I didn't have a road map of where to go to next so I spent a lot of time and effort sitting and thinking of what to work on next.

To solve these problems I have done the following:
  1. Designed a good portion of this project on paper to know what I should expect to write and what problems might arise.
  2. Wrote down a fairly straight-fortward todo list to keep track of my progress and make sure I complete what I'm working on before I move on to the next step.
  3. Used a stop, compile, test, and proceed method of programming to minimize time spent debugging.
  4. Attempted to follow a design principles:
      - minimum functionality/minimum redundancy - functionality is only given to those classes that need it or need it as an interface
      - factory design pattern - for managing a potentially large number of types of objects, this is needed to make this feasible and scalable.

Here is my current todo list:
